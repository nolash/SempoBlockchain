remember you need to add the following to your PYTHONPATH env var:

 - .
 - $REPOROOT
 - $REPOROOT/app
 - $REPOROOT/eth_worker

remember also to set your DEPLOYMENT_NAME env var in the most likely event that you are using your own config files


for both examples you have to have a worker serving the eth_manager tasks. I used:

$ celery -A eth_manager worker --loglevel=DEBUG --concurrency=4 --pool=eventlet -Q=high-priority --without-gossip --without-mingle


the main.py file is run straightforward, and will send a task to that worker



the beat will call a task we serve ourselves, so we need to start two additional celery processes for this example (while the eth_manager one is still running). In two different terminals run:

$ celery -A xyzzy.taskzz.celeree beat --loglevel=DEBUG
$Â celery -A xyzzy.taskzz.celeree worker --loglevel=DEBUG 

You should see movement in all three terminals running celery processes.


Note a couple of things:

- no problem to access the db from the app.tasks.celeree.foo task
- if celeree was called celery you wouldh't have to name it explicitly. I renamed it to show the full path to the object that celery calls
-
